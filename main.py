# Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number.
# For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”.
# For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.”
# Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have.
# Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.
# Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout teh game and tell the user at the end.
